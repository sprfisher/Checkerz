# CheckersInHTML
Play checkers against a minimax algorithm that at the moment of writing this description calculates the best move possible in the board. The AI is curently only able to "think" one move. Further improvements will accompany future updates.

This version of checkers does not contain the constraint of forcing the player to capture an opponents piece when the opportunity presents itself.
